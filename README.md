# smooth-sparse-compression
Experimental Python implementation of smooth compression using sparse linear mappings and bounded-degree nonlinear functions, inspired by Montanari–Mossel’s smooth sparse-graph codes. Provides tools to measure collision rates, smoothness, and rate-overhead trade-offs for Bernoulli sources near Shannon’s entropy bound.
